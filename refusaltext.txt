I am joining a nation-wide boycott against Elsevier in Finland,
following the failure to reach an agreement in the negotiations with
the Finnish University Libraries in 2016. The libraries demanded fair
pricing and increases to open access. While many other countries have
similar demands, Elsevier keeps on blocking the inevitable transition
to open access. Elsevier also holds reported profit margins of 30-40%
(!) while relying on voluntary services of the scientific community.
These policies do not serve the needs of the scientific community and
should come to an end.
