- Coarse longitudinal data on the overall costs 1986-2015
- Only PDF data
- Longitudinal dataset. Discloses the median total annual amount paid by 99 ARL member libraries concerning serial expenditure (since 2012 labeled as “Ongoing expenses”). In 1986 the median annual amount was $1 517 724 USD, in 1996 $3 384 928 USD (+123%), in 2006  $6 289 768 USD (+314%), and in 2015  $9 427 446 USD (+521%). During this timeframe (1986-2015) the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States increased by a total of 118%. Drawback of this data is lack of per-publisher and per-library
- Bergstrom and McAfee together with economist Paul Courant founded the “Big Deal Contract Project” where the goal was to make public the prices and contract terms of publisher deals made by university libraries in the United States (econ.ucsb.edu 2009). By invoking state Freedom of Information acts and requesting copies of recent site-license contracts signed with nine major publishers the researchers were able to collect more than 360 contracts belonging to 55 university libraries and 12 library consortia.A thorough analysis on this effort was published as Bergstrom et al (2014). The analysis of the big deal contracts reveals that there is considerable variation in prices among the publishers.
