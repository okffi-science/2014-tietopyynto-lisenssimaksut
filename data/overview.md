The most comprehensive longitudinal per publisher data sets are available from 
Canada (2014-2016), Chile (2008-2015), Finland (2010-2016), France (2009-2015), Netherlands (2011-2015), and UK (2010-2016). Data for Argentina (2008-2016) is also available but we could not verify the source. In most countries, the data is available only for some of the largest publishers and/or institutions.

Figure  1: Annual cost increase for Elsevier, Wiley/Blackwell and Springer. The cost information for these 3 publishers is available for all 5 countries with longitudinal data. The remarkable cost increase in 2016 is associated with notable increase of listed publishers and organizations in the data set (57 vs. 71 organizations 2015-2016; and 200 vs. 258 publishers).
