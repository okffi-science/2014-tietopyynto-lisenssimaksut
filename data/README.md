Brazil: 2013
- Brazil has an nation wide agreement providing journal access to 423 academic and research institutions. It is called Portal de Periódicos, provided by CAPES. According to its 2013 financial report [1], last year CAPES spent US$ 93,872,151.11 (with US$ 31,644,204.12 paid to Elsevier). Some institutions that are not covered by the agreement, as they do not meet the eligibility criteria, had to pay in separate in order to get access to this portal, spending additional US$ 11,560,438.93.

This has been reported. On 20161222 the University of Amsterdam spokesperson gave the correct data for UvA via Twitter. Early January VSNU uploaded new data and graphics with corrections in the UvA data.

- coarse longitudinal data on the overall costs is available 1986-2015
- Only PDF data ? Perhaps we could get some more by asking ?
- Longitudinal dataset. Discloses the median total annual amount paid by 99 ARL member libraries concerning serial expenditure (since 2012 labeled as “Ongoing expenses”). In 1986 the median annual amount was $1 517 724 USD, in 1996 $3 384 928 USD (+123%), in 2006  $6 289 768 USD (+314%), and in 2015  $9 427 446 USD (+521%). During this timeframe (1986-2015) the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States increased by a total of 118%. Drawback of this data is lack of per-publisher and per-library
- Bergstrom and McAfee together with economist Paul Courant founded the “Big Deal Contract Project” where the goal was to make public the prices and contract terms of publisher deals made by university libraries in the United States (econ.ucsb.edu 2009). By invoking state Freedom of Information acts and requesting copies of recent site-license contracts signed with nine major publishers the researchers were able to collect more than 360 contracts belonging to 55 university libraries and 12 library consortia.A thorough analysis on this effort was published as Bergstrom et al (2014). The analysis of the big deal contracts reveals that there is considerable variation in prices among the publishers. [More summary of Bergstrom 2014 here]
