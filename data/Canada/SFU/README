Data at http://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/overview/collections/serials-costs.

The API endpoint: http://api.lib.sfu.ca/serialcosts

To retrieve all of the data, issue a call to the 'list' endpoint for
every year you are interested in, then, for each of the titles in the
yearly result set, issue a 'search' query by ISSN to get the title's
cost data, broken down by year.
