Brazil: 2013
- Brazil has an nation wide agreement providing journal access to 423 academic and research institutions. It is called Portal de Peri√≥dicos, provided by CAPES. According to its 2013 financial report, last year CAPES spent US$ 93,872,151.11 (with US$ 31,644,204.12 paid to Elsevier). Some institutions that are not covered by the agreement, as they do not meet the eligibility criteria, had to pay in separate in order to get access to this portal, spending additional US$ 11,560,438.93.
